  <h1>Dream Singles America</h1>
  <p class="note"><strong>Coming soon:</strong> a dating community built by and for verified U.S. citizens.</p>

  <p>
    You found the upcoming dating website, <strong>Dream Singles America</strong>.
    We're the new version inspired by Dream-Singles.com that is <em>only for American citizens who are verified</em>
    (as U.S. citizens) and are looking for people who are already in the United States and do not require
    immigration attention to be here.
  </p>

  <p>
    This service is also <strong>U.S.-based</strong>, unlike Dream-Singles.com, which is based overseas.
    Our version follows U.S. laws and standards and, more than that, United States “taste” in service and pricing.
  </p>

  <h2>What to expect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Verified U.S. citizenship for all members.</li>
    <li>U.S.-hosted platform with U.S. compliance and consumer protections.</li>
    <li>Focus on people already living in the United States—no immigration processing.</li>
    <li>Transparent, U.S.-style pricing and customer support.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We look forward to serving you and—if you are a Dream-Singles.com user—
    we look forward to showing you the <strong>United States hospitality</strong> that only an
    <strong>award‑winning U.S. software developer</strong> can deliver. <strong>Stay tuned!</strong>
